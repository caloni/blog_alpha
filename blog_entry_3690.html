<p>Uma sÃ©rie de duas temporadas apresenta um rapaz magro, bem alto e cheio de adereÃ§os. Ele junta um grupo de jovens desajustados sem nenhuma experiÃªncia em ficar com mulheres. Seu objetivo: tornÃ¡-los mestres na arte de pegaÃ§Ã£o.</p>
<p>Alguns anos depois surge este livro, uma versÃ£o atualizada em que Mistery, o rapaz magro, irÃ¡ narrar alguns momentos junto de seus "dudes" e como consequÃªncia dar aquelas dicas matadoras na arte do sexo e amor.</p>
<p># Recortes</p>
<p>> I honestly feel like I am a master at this. Not because I can get any womanâ€”that, of course, is impossibleâ€”but because my pickups are so controlled and smooth; not sleazy, but rather natural. I love women. I especially love the adventure and the companionship. I love being in a strange girlâ€™s apartment. She takes care of me and I feel like a king. And when I leave, I go to another girlâ€™s place and get the same great treatment all over again.</p>
<p>> You might feel lonely and decide to go out, and within two hours your life changes. You meet a girl and she is attracted to you. And sheâ€™s hot. And you are at her house listening to new music and eating new foods and exploring a new life. They have issues you can listen to and learn from. Itâ€™s a great big soap opera and you are the star.</p>
<p>> Say it with me: Find, meet, attract, close. Find, meet, attract, close. The details and subtleties, however, are the heart of the system.</p>
<p>> â€œWe just want everyone to have as much fun as we do, because so many guys in the bar donâ€™t know what they are doing.â€</p>
<p>> MYSTERYâ€™S TOP 10 TIPS 1) Get into the habit of starting conversations just for the practice. Release your outcome and be relaxed in the process. 2) Between approaches, always remember to smile while mingling. 3) Lean back and relax when you initiate conversations. Donâ€™t lean in. Speak slowly and expressively. This alone will improve your game by 300 percent. 4) Be chattyâ€”reallyâ€”and convey a strong sense of fascination. Talk about relationships and the mysterious, and use lots of humor as well as emotional and sensory descriptions. Enthusiasm is contagious. 5) Donâ€™t say anything to impress her, such as bragging about your job, girls, or friends. Instead, indirectly convey value via demonstration and incidental story details. If she can tell that you are trying to impress her, she will perceive you as lower value. 6) Donâ€™t act as if anything is a big deal. Be fun and playful. Vibe with her, but donâ€™t react to her. Act the same way you would act with your eight-year-old niece. 7) As you hang out with her, and she has an opportunity to win you over, then show her your increasing interest. She must recognize that she has genuinely won you over with her personality. 8) Balance indicators of interest with indicators of disinterest. Do this both in your conversation with her and also as you escalate with her physically. This has a great effect. 9) Wear one accessory that gives other people an excuse to initiate a conversation with you, such as a hat, or a certain ring or necklace. Have a good story prepared for when this happens. 10) Have a life. Go to the gym and stay in shape, and continually improve your wardrobe. Cultivate your circle of female friends. Throw parties. Put effort into your social circle. A girl should imagine herself being a part of your cool life.</p>
<p>> Lesson One: Women give off signals when they are attracted to you.</p>
<p>> Lesson Two: Touching should be a normal and constant part of the way you interact with other people, from the very beginning. There should never be some big moment, but instead a series of tiny little moments, and theyâ€™re always no big deal.</p>
<p>> Lesson Three: Force yourself to start using innocuous social touches as a normal part of your conversation with a woman, such as touching her shoulder as you say something to her. Just force yourself to use more touching during your social interactions.</p>
<p>> Lesson Four: Touch her absentmindedly, as though you yourself are not even aware that you are touching her.</p>
<p>> Lesson Five: Whenever you do something that signals that you are interested in her, such as touching her shoulder, then soften the impact of that interest by also doing something to signal disinterest, such as looking away while you touch her. Of course, that is only an exampleâ€”be sure to play around with various combinations.</p>
<p>> Lesson Six: Your touches should appear as though they are a natural part of your words, even though they may be completely unrelated, logically, to whatever you are actually saying.</p>
<p>> Lesson Seven: Touch and release, touch and release. You are the one who makes the move, and you are also the one who pushes it away. She will never be in a position to â€œrejectâ€ you because you already pushed her away first.</p>
<p>> Lesson Eight: Always use baby steps to get what you want. Never try to get too much at once.</p>
<p>> Lesson Nine: Itâ€™s not about avoiding rejection; itâ€™s about responding to it attractively.</p>
<p>> Even when a woman doesnâ€™t go along with your move, donâ€™t react in the slightest! Act completely normal. Youâ€™re just the kind of guy who likes to have fun and who doesnâ€™t take anything too seriously. Act as if you didnâ€™t really even notice what happened. In fact, feel free to keep making moves on her as long as she remains in your proximity.</p>
<p>> Lesson Ten: Disinterest creates feelings of comfort. If she is being resistant to your touch, then use more disinterest. For example, toss her hand away, turn your body away from her, or talk to someone else in the group. Do not do this as though you are trying to punish her, but rather as though itâ€™s no big deal.</p>
<p>> Lesson Eleven: Whenever a woman is compliant to one of your moves, reward her with your growing attention and appreciation. In other words, give her your green lights, but only when she feels like she has earned it. Get her to work for it.</p>
<p>> But emotions donâ€™t understand logical ideas like that. Emotions are preprogrammed behavioral modifiers hardwired into your brain through one hundred and twenty thousand years of natural selection in human evolution. It is in fact these built-in motivators (called emotions) that assisted millions of people before you to live long enough and motivated these ancestors to mate. In other words, look at emotions as indicators telling you what your body believes is most important to you.â€</p>
<p>> I said, â€œLook at it this way. Have you ever been having sex with a girl and you think to yourself, â€˜Why is she letting me do this? Me! Why!?â€™ Well, they do. So stop asking yourself that. Just enjoy it. The same is true when you are conversing with a girl. Donâ€™t bother thinking, Why is she letting me talk to her?! Itâ€™s insecure of you and that doesnâ€™t look good. People can feel it. Just relax. Itâ€™s a Zen thing.â€</p>

<p>> Lovedrop continued: â€œThe list that you see on the mirror represents the ideal vibe for interacting socially, and for being attractive to women. The Ghost and the Flame. We like to call this â€˜the Zen of Cool.â€™ I believe that once you get this right, you donâ€™t need any other game. Go ahead and write the list down in your notes.</p>
<p>> â€œRemember, people react more to those of higher value, and by reacting, they lose value in comparison. Do the opposite. React less, and you will come across as higher value. Be â€˜cool.â€™ People can sense this vibe and they will find you attractive. When you react less to them, it causes other people to react more to you. This is why itâ€™s so important to speak slowly, with pauses, and to move slowly, avoiding fidgeting, and to lean back instead of leaning in, and to open over your shoulder, and so on.</p>
<p>> â€œSo, suggestion: Walk up to strangers and behave in your mind as if you know them. Just start talking to strangers about whatâ€™s on your mind. I do this and it really helps.</p>
<p>> â€œThe Ghost is about being unaffected by things. In part, itâ€™s about not getting caught up in a wave of negative emotion, even and especially when someone is out of line.</p>
<p>> â€œYou were attempting to educate them here. That is not your job. Donâ€™t bother educating people when they are stupid. Just leave. Once you go into damage control, just leave. Move on. Itâ€™s more mature and more efficient. Be an artist, not a guy.â€</p>
<p>> â€œActing normal around beautiful women is a way of conveying preselection. That is, conveying that there are other beautiful women in our lives. Women are women everywhere. Behaviors are preprogrammed by a womanâ€™s genes. Her genes are selfish and wish to replicate with the help of the best males. Show you are the best by acting like you get lots of girls. Not by saying thisâ€”you could be lyingâ€”but by behaving as if you get them. Act normal around beautiful girls and this will indicate that youâ€™re used to being around them.â€</p>
<p>> â€œGirls generally dislike a shy guy. They want a man who is outgoing. Once you have agreed with this statement, it becomes your job to play outgoing. You can be shy, but you hide that fact. It is a must to be outgoing. I donâ€™t think acting shy helps you out. Now, if the girl is shy, be outgoing still, just not so outgoing that you blow her out.</p>
<p>> â€œLet us kindly differentiate between a nice guy and a gentleman. Like Satan himself, a womanizer or pickup artist is a gentleman, but not a nice guy. A gentleman will open the door for a lady, but wonâ€™t for a bitch. But he will smile as the door closes on herâ€”see Rhett Butler. A nice guy will open doors for all the bitches in the world and get no thank-yous and will still do it.</p>
<p>> â€œThis difficulty you have, Nice Guy, to tell someone to fuck off when you need to, tells me you have a problem with self-esteem. You need to set your rules and live by them. And when people break the rules, they pay the price. That is the type of man a ten wants. The man with the plan. Take charge. When you donâ€™t know the answer, get in there anyway. Attitude beats knowledge. Donâ€™t worry about what others think. Girls want a man in charge.</p>
<p>> â€œWhat if things go wrong?â€ asked Adam. â€œFind a new girl instead of fixing things,â€ I replied. â€œThing is, I noticed itâ€™s easier to just find a new girl than to work on damage control issues.â€</p>
<p>> â€œI suggest hunting with the sex in mind first,â€ I replied, â€œand then, the relationship is an option afterward. To hunt for a relationship first keeps you from having sex, keeps you from learning, scares many girls away, and prolongs the relationship from becoming deep. Get things sexual first, then choose how far you want the relationship to go from there. Itâ€™s more logical, more efficient, more reliable to getting long-term relationships, and, well, more fun. Why chase only for relationships when you can do that and see many girls until the right relationship girl comes along?â€</p>
<p>> â€œWhen I donâ€™t feel like going out,â€ I replied, â€œI have my friends force me. When I donâ€™t feel like getting dressed I have my friends say, â€˜Dude, get dressed.â€™ When I am in the car not wanting to go in because Iâ€™m tired, I say to myself, â€˜Just take a look inside.â€™ When I get in and I donâ€™t want to enter a set I think, If I donâ€™t, Iâ€™ll stale the room and blow my cover. If I have a bad set, I say, â€˜Recover soldier,â€™ and press on. If itâ€™s five minutes from closing and my night was shit, I think, Maybe my dream girl is to be found in the last five minutes. My night may change to a great night! Iâ€™ve had that happen before.</p>
<p>> â€œWhen we go out tonight, get numbers! Go for four of them tonight. Thatâ€™s about one per hour. How hard is that? You have an hour to meet three women and do it up. One out of three should like you if you act like Rhett. Thatâ€™s only twelve girls to chat with. Not rocket science. The first is hard; the rest get easy for the day. Tell me how many girls you chatted with. If you say, â€˜Only two,â€™ and didnâ€™t get any numbers, then we know where your problem lies already. If there werenâ€™t girls worthy of getting, you went to the wrong place. So much for the use of your intellect. If you didnâ€™t go for sevens and eights, you messed up. They were practice for you. They could have friends that you do like. They could be friends and join you in your future days of hunting!</p>
<p>> A true artist doesnâ€™t use pickup lines. He uses intro scripting. His intros are polished and nonsexist. His routines are natural, humorous, and fun. His attitude toward the subject is that of a professional. He systematically finds the best places and works the rooms. He treats everyone with respect and dignity. Even the other guys. All is fair in love and war, but this war is merely a game. So letâ€™s not kill or hurt anyone on this game of love.</p>
<p>> â€œRULE: Plan your strategy for finding women. Know exactly where you intend to go. Know your city. Know the day. Minimize waste of time by getting there a bit early so you can settle in.</p>
<p>> â€œRULE: Never buy a girl a drink. This makes you seem like every other guy. She may, however, buy you a drink.</p>
<p>> â€œRULE: Avoid drinking too much alcohol when playing the game. Alcohol is an excuse to alter your feeling of â€˜fear.â€™ You decrease your statistical chances of success. Sober people have more reaction time with which to process information.</p>
<p>> â€œRULE: Never give your number to a girl unless there is an exchange. If you get around to asking for her number and she says, â€˜Iâ€™ll call you,â€™ just say, â€˜No, Iâ€™ll call you.â€™ If she doesnâ€™t give her number, she wouldnâ€™t call you anyway, so just say, â€˜Nice meeting you,â€™ and leave. After a girl does give her number to you, you may then write yours for her as you say, â€˜Weâ€™ll trade â€¦ fair?â€™ She will smile and say, â€˜Fair.â€™</p>
<p>> â€œGoing for fives is just a self-esteem thing, not a skills thing. If you decide to chase nines and tens and only them, then that will be the skill set you get good at. They arenâ€™t harder to get, only different.</p>
<p>> â€œSociety has its mating rituals. When a woman wants to find a mate, she will get emotions driving her to seek social situations. She doesnâ€™t bother getting dressed and looking good just to dance. Dancing is even a way of showing the health of the body for a suitorâ€”you! She is seeking a mate. And yes, she will go to a place where there are possible mates. Granted, she will only pick the best. But girls donâ€™t put body and looks high on the priority list. The top three traits are a good smile, a sense of humor, and confidence. The fourth is connection, by the way. So there you go.â€</p>
<p>> â€œThe problem is,â€ I replied, â€œpeople donâ€™t go to public gatherings without music. When there is no music, many people are too scared to chat with strangers so they feel uncomfortable and donâ€™t go to that place. Thing is, most people arenâ€™t players. A club is actually very logical. You are thinking about only your intentions. See, for a girl, the main reason to be there is to meet a guy. But, they have to do something to look busy while in there. Some need an alternative excuse, like coming to drink with friends, which is utterly absurd. Who the hell really wants to pay five dollars just to get into a noisy place to talk with friends? Then youâ€™ve got the old-style mating ritual: dancing. This shows off your health, vitality, and physique. Everyone has a different way of meeting others. Thing is, players should know the most efficient way. This doesnâ€™t mean the rest of the world does, too. So it looks like noisy clubs are the way. They attract lots of people. What other thing does that without actually taking the peopleâ€™s attention totally, as a play or concert does? The entire club industry is designed to make money off people wanting to meet a mate.</p>
<p>> The benefit of being in a club is quantity. There simply are more opportunities to see women of beauty. With that benefit comes a series of shitty things. Noise, crowds, dark, alcohol, male competition, raised bitch shields are just some, never mind cover charges. But the benefit outweighs all the shit. The solution is to minimize the shit. Here is how: â€œNoise: Donâ€™t approach girls in the loud areas. There are always a couple of areas of a club that are the least noisy. That is the field. Around the dance floor? That is the trap. You canâ€™t initiate a chat there so why be there? I know, to look at the girls you canâ€™t approach. Fuck that. Stay out of the trap. Itâ€™s a trap. Dance floors are not a pickup field. â€œCrowds: Go early. Approach the bartenders and hostesses early. Get in early. Ten P.M. Get there at nine-thirty P.M. if you have to. This usually saves you money on the cover, too. Solve crowd issues by working crowds. Donâ€™t approach a single girl. Approach a group of people. This allows you the ability to display social proof. At midnight, bail out to another clubâ€”it keeps the crowd fresh for you and offers the opportunity to instant-date girls as they join you to the next club. â€œDark: Stay in the lit areas. Usually they are the most quiet and least crowded. See, pickup is like fishing. Having a fish on the line is the exception to the general rule. Wait and wait and wait is the general rule. Then a woman comes in from the dance floor and, bam, you yank the line. Hook them. Three-Second Rule it and address the targetâ€™s entire group. So in a way, the fishing pole is changed into a net. â€œAlcohol: Itâ€™s hard enough when theyâ€™re drunk. A pickup artistâ€™s game is always better when heâ€™s not drunk. Donâ€™t drink, and keep the sharpnessâ€”trust me, pal, youâ€™re gonna need it when a girl is in front of you.1 â€œMale competition: Yes, there are more guys. But they donâ€™t smile. They donâ€™t surround themselves with people and talk talk talk and laugh. They donâ€™t walk around holding the smile on their face. They hold a beer on their chest and lean in and â€˜look cool.â€™ A pickup artist realizes that the only obstacle with regards to other males is that the more faces exist in there, the more busy the vibe will be. Like MTV rather than C-SPAN. Solution: Be MTV yourself! That is why gimmicks are useful. â€œBitch shields: Yes, they are higher. But the solution is not to punch through it, but to trick her to lower the shield. How? Group theory and negs. Approach the group while ignoring the target and using negs on her. Disarm the friends with stories and humor, and when they all love you, you can finally turn to the target. By this time the negs sank in and lowered her self-esteem. Her shield down, she wants attention from you, the life of the partyâ€”the guy who sort of pushed her out of the spotlight of her own circle of friends. And there you have it. Add more groups so that the next group will have noticed you in a previous group (social proof) and the closes come caving in like a nuclear reaction.</p>
<p>> THE STRIPPER RULES RULE: She doesnâ€™t like the word stripper. Use dancer, or exotic dancer. RULE: Donâ€™t assume that just because a woman makes money by peeling off her clothes, she is stupid. On the contrary, they are brighter than most of the men in there. Remember, if she can trick guys into thinking that she likes them, she makes more money. RULE: The minute they dance for you for money, you are a customer and they donâ€™t sleep with customers. So donâ€™t let her dance for youâ€”unless itâ€™s for free. They suffer from low self-esteem but hide it very well. They are dealing with a lot of issues emotionally in their head while they dance for you and because they generally think you donâ€™t respect them after a dance, you canâ€™t get in. Plus now she sees you as a customer. RULE: Donâ€™t stay there longâ€”thirty minutes, max, and only if you are into a chat with one. I initiate chat faster standing than sitting, so I go into a two-set of sitting girls and become more exciting with my conversation than any guy during the entire day. RULE: Enthusiasm is contagious. Act enthused about something that happened to you and so will they. RULE: Convey that your day has been incredible and then proceed to explain why. As if meeting her is completely secondary. Nothing can wreck this day! When a girl comes to sit, I talk my ass off, conveying my personality. I take over. RULE: Donâ€™t buy her a drink, or anything, for that matter. And donâ€™t expect to actually land a stripper youâ€™ve tipped. Sure, tip a girl onstage but that wonâ€™t help get her. In fact it will hurt. Keep the money in your pocketâ€”you are there for getting girls, not for the entertainment of only looking at them. You are not a customer, you are a pickup artist. RULE: Have a performer imageâ€”appeal to the performer in them. This is where the stereotype comes from that strippers date losers in a rock band, because they are attracted to fellow performers. Use photos because they are so bored in there; a little look at some pics on your cellphone is a welcome escape. Let the photos convey you to be fucking cool. Talk about the excitement onstage. Get them to think outside the club. When leading their imagination, lead them into daylight, not night. Most guys think night only, and convey only this. The fellow performer approach together with the â€˜I am the Stripper Boyfriend Typeâ€™ has worked for me. RULE: Be the Stripper Boyfriend Type. Stripper boyfriends are different. Once a stripper knows you had a stripper for a girlfriend, she knows your caliber. It was easier to get another stripper once I had already had one. And peacockâ€”wear what you want to attract. Your image needs to back up your game. Trust me, getting a stripper is not harder, only different. Some are very nice girls. Itâ€™s just a job, remember. There is a way to get them. Iâ€™ve gone out with several dancers, one for two years, so I know the scene. I lived with her. I was one of those stripper boyfriends. Experiment with this line and use it in the clubs with an air of cockiness, yet in a humorous way: â€˜Do you know my ex-girlfriend Vanessa? She used to work here. I forget her stage names â€˜cause she changed them as often as she did her underwearâ€”once every two weeks. And now you know why she is my ex.â€™ Use the name Vanessa, too. RULE: Explain that you are well aware that all this is bullshit (the whole concept of stripping). Itâ€™s just an entertainment formâ€”good money. No big deal. Then drop the subject and donâ€™t talk about her world again. Bring her to your daylight world. Once she is out to the cafÃ© or food place after, then you go vampire world on her. Strippers generally love the vampire romance stuff. RULE: Use humor and donâ€™t hit on her, or compliment her. RULE: Treat all strippers as 10s and use negs, because they are in a mental state of control while in their own territory. They hate sniveling losers. Negs work well. RULE: Be slick on the close. Donâ€™t ask for the number. Make them ask you! Better yet, tell her you donâ€™t want to pick her up in the club even though you arenâ€™t a customer. Tell her to meet you outside but also tell her, â€œDonâ€™t expect much from meâ€”Iâ€™m just hungry, okay?â€ RULE: Most strippers are open-mindedâ€”they believe in stupid shit like ESP. Use that. Ghosts, too. Very interesting conversational threads stem from these supernatural beliefs. Many are in fact Wiccan and wear a pentacleâ€”most strippers like rock music and long hair but some like dance music and short hair. Know which type you want, of the two types. Some good conversational topics are God, the soul, UFOs, ESP, telekinesis, mind over matter, ghosts, poltergeist, crop circles, Atlantis, acupuncture, psychoanalysis, parapsychology, Sasquatch, the Loch Ness Monster, heaven, hell, Buddha, aromatherapy, psi powers, psychics, spells, Jesus as anything more than a magician, out-of-body experiences, levitation, twins having a psychic bond, witchcraft, demons, hauntings, exorcisms, Reiki, monogamy as a natural human behavior, and prayer. Iâ€™m just throwing it out there. RULE: Be big. Be the center of attention. Donâ€™t think that the quiet seduction will work in the strip club. No sexual shit in the club. Once you have intrigued her enough to join you, she already decided she likes you. RULE: Get to know the DJâ€”become his buddy. Hang out with him. Go for beers afterward. Seduce him in a way. He will lead you to all the women. RULE: Make her think that you think she wants you. Be a challenge. RULE: Connect using â€œI live my life one day at a timeâ€ frames. RULE: Connect using â€œSo many people are so judgmental about things. You seem really open and fun â€¦â€ Good luck.</p>
<p>> Our goal when opening is merely to start the microcalibration process, and you only need a bit of mundane material to do that effectively, as long as your delivery is good.</p>
<p>> Most guys, they approach asking questions, they approach trying to impress, trying to get something. They are all about taking value. But if youâ€™re a pickup artist, you are there to add value, not to take it away.</p>
<p>> 1) You can eject anytime with â€œThatâ€™s my thought for the day,â€ then turn away. If they were entertained by your pacing, energy, enthusiasm, smile, or sense of humor, they may give you an IOI.</p>
<p>> 2) You turn your back to test them and if they say â€œSo â€¦â€ and try to reinitiate the conversation, itâ€™s a positive IOI and you may continue with your next routine or just say â€œPleasure meeting youâ€ and bail out.</p>
<p>> 3) Once you have consistently gotten your targets laughing with the Elvis Script, you will have learned timing and pacing and such. You will have already begun to see the repeating patterns in all the approaches. VoilÃ ! Now you are free from any need of â€œkiller materialâ€â€”your delivery is what will hook the set. After that all you need is what we call â€œthe absurd,â€ which I will teach you soon.</p>
<p>> Rather, what you want to do is just toss out a little piece of value. Itâ€™s actually better that itâ€™s only a little piece of value, rather than some mind-blowing routine. Itâ€™s easier for the set to hook to.</p>
<p>> So if you are thinking about it properly, opening isnâ€™t about reciting some magic spell. Itâ€™s just about tossing that first piece, and the next piece, and so on.</p>
<p>> â€œYou see, the cycle of Bait-Hook-Reel-Release starts in the very beginning, at the opener. And it just continues to cycle outward from there, escalating as she complies first to your approach, and then she complies to vibing with you, and then as you continue to flip her attraction switches, she will comply to jump through your conversational hoops. Eventually she will comply with your physical escalation more and more, as you qualify her and flip her connection switches. Game is really about building compliance, and microcalibration is the process for doing that. Bait-Hook-Reel-Release. And it all starts with the opener.</p>
<p>> Notice that what really hooks the set is not the line itself, but the â€˜energy, enthusiasm, smile, and sense of humor.â€™ And, when you are able to get consistent laughs, â€˜you will have learned timing and pacing.â€™</p>
<p>> By giving her a back-turn as an indicator of disinterest, I am provoking her to reinitiate the conversationâ€”and preserving her comfort levels in the meantime.</p>
<p>> Microcalibration is about tossing out value bit by bit, and then calibrating her responses by giving her IODs when she gives you IODs, and by giving her compliance tests when she gives you IOIs.</p>
<p>> Over the years, as she rejects so many men, the repetition causes her to develop autopilot responses for filtering them out more quickly. The typical lines men use have become a trigger in her mind. But I donâ€™t trigger any of her rejection circuits, because I speak to her as one friend to another.</p>
<p>> (B) I IMMEDIATELY LEAD HER INTO AN EXPERIENCE. I say things like â€œI was flying all around here in Google Earth â€¦â€ and â€œLook at this seashell. I was walking with some friends â€¦â€ and â€œWhen I was a kid, I wentâ€¦â€ Notice how my words focus on stimulating the listener and creating an experience, rather than trying to win approval or get something.</p>
<p>> But I do the opposite of thisâ€”I show disinterest toward the target, disarming her, but I show great interest in what I am saying. My excitement about my words causes her to also feel excited about my words. She begins to find me intriguing.</p>
<p>> (F) I DONâ€™T IMPOSE UPON THE GROUP, I ENTICE THEM. They donâ€™t feel pressured to commit to some long discussion or pushy sales pitch. There is no implied demand for a certain level of participation. They donâ€™t have to defend themselves from some needy agenda. They feel safe to respond freely, without fear of provoking anger or encouraging neediness.</p>
<p>> When I open a set, I donâ€™t need to impress them, or win their approval, or prove myself to anyone. I just offer the tiniest bit of conversational valueâ€”just being friendlyâ€”and all I need is for someone to bite just enough so that I can toss them the next bit, and the next bit.</p>
<p>> The best way is to open sets that are already in your proximity, so that you donâ€™t have to approach them in the first place.</p>
<p>> If you must approach a set in order to get close enough to open them, draw near to them at a 45-degree angle. Walk very slowly and comfortably, as though you are in your own world. Donâ€™t walk straight toward them or come from directly behind them. Do all these things for the same reason that you would avoid spooking an animal.</p>
<p>> As you walk along that curve and get closer to the group, you then â€œnoticeâ€ them out of the corner of your eye, and then you â€œspontaneouslyâ€ think to open them. That is when you turn your head naturally, and open them over your shoulder.</p>
<p>> To disarm any suspicions, use false time constraints and body rocking. It is very disarming when you come across as carefree and unaffected.</p>
<p>> Do not turn your body to face toward the group until they are turning toward you in the same way. If you appear eager, you could get blown out. Be aware of how the value differential is affected by your physical positioning.</p>
<p>> Remember, if you do not add value, then you are just another guy whoâ€™s only here to get something.</p>
<p>> The energy level of your personality should be calibrated to be high enough to stimulate the set, but without spooking them. The reason I say to calibrate energy levels is that it will spook the set if you come in too energetically. Anyone who has approached a thousand sets will already know this intuitively, so get a feel for it.</p>
<p>> Donâ€™t milk the openerâ€” just take control of the conversation and practice stacking forward to your next piece of material. Better yet, vibe with them and practice getting into a fun, humorous mood, which is more important than using canned routines. Routines are only training wheels to get you started.</p>
<p>> â€œStack the openers and yes, if an opener doesnâ€™t work, donâ€™t finish it. Just cut yourself off and open with another one (stacking) just like a comedian does if a joke starts to stall the audience. He just drops it and moves on to another bit from scratch. Youâ€™ve got to be super ready for this. And, if you finally open the set, you canâ€”but only if you wantâ€”go back and finish up open threads during the pickup.â€</p>
<p>> â€œThere is no such thing as a second first impression,â€ I replied. â€œItâ€™s a â€˜one time at batâ€™ sort of thing. A girl will decide, based on the first five minutes of knowing you, whether or not she is interested.</p>
<p>> Passion is not something that builds over weeks but instead ignites instantly. The best relationships come from beginning passionately.</p>
<p>> â€œThat is the plan. Train as if every girl is merely practice for the next one and you wonâ€™t get nervous to mess up, because nothing important is on the line. Once you start playing, itâ€™s more fun. The first three approaches are always the hardest of the night.</p>
<p>> â€œSometimes itâ€™s hard to view practicing pickup as fun!â€ exclaimed Adam. â€œPersonally,â€ I said, â€œI think itâ€™s a blast. If, after all the stress and fear, you arenâ€™t having fun practicing pickup, you need to get yourself another hobby.</p>
<p>> Go out alone. All the best Venusian artists do it. Itâ€™s fun to explore by yourself. Approach everyone. Become a social guy. Fake your smile. It will biofeedback and make you feel better. Crash and burn. Experiment! Open hotties with â€œSo â€¦ who the hell are you?â€ Talk to strangers. Donâ€™t try to make them like you. Instead, make them think you are from the future.</p>
<p>> â€œThink of this as surfing,â€ I said. â€œItâ€™s like youâ€™re surfing people and every potential approach is the next wave. And you have to take them all on. Or think of it as a video game.â€</p>
<p>> â€œWell,â€ I said, â€œfirst of all, consider removing redundant sentences from your intro. How are you? Excuse me. Howâ€™s it going? How are you tonight? How are you today? Can I ask you a</p>
<p>> â€œStarting the conversation by asking for directions is bad, because it will cause an uncomfortable transition when you change the thread to something more conversational.</p>
<p>> Also, itâ€™s not asking directions. Girls know that is a possible line. They are cautious and you havenâ€™t disarmed them. The Elvis Script disarms the â€˜heâ€™s hitting on meâ€™ emotion.â€</p>
<p>> Just look around sometime and notice that most guys hold their drinks up highâ€”higher than heart level even. Those are the scared ones. I wonder if you can remember where you had your drink all this time. If itâ€™s high up, itâ€™s time to change, â€˜cause you are conveying fear. Leave the drink at the bar!â€</p>
<p>> Smile 100 percent of the time. Smile at everyone! Eye contact to all in the group. Donâ€™t wait for a smile back. Say hi. Pause and then use your opener. Donâ€™t be a smart-ass. Donâ€™t annoy. Be genuine.</p>
<p>> â€œI canâ€™t believe that so many people hit up against the bitch shield and they actually think she is really like that. They leave thinking, â€˜Oh man, Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t get her; sheâ€™s such a bitch.â€™ Well, by giving you the attitude, she got rid of you, yes? This is a typical tactic of particularly beautiful women. They learned this through years of men hitting on them to the point of annoyance. So you have to be different and not hit on them. That is what negs are all about.</p>
<p>> â€œâ€˜Excuse meâ€™ sucks. It just doesnâ€™t work. I wish it would but we all know it doesnâ€™t. She doesnâ€™t care. â€˜Excuse me what? Fuck off. Iâ€™ve got better things to do than get hit on by some guy in a doorway, buddy.â€™ Never use â€˜excuse meâ€™ as an opener. Ever.</p>
<p>> Please donâ€™t introduce yourself and give an excuse as to why you approached, as this shows a low self-esteem. Donâ€™t give reasons. Just talk. The only reason you should have is â€˜Iâ€™m entertaining myself.â€™ Go in really fun. I mean point to things and say â€˜Bam! Killed it!â€™ Donâ€™t try to pick her up. Instead merely convey an amazing personality and let her close you.</p>
<p>> Are your friends approaching groups? If they arenâ€™t doing group theory, theyâ€™re cutting themselves off at the knees. There are women in the bar who went out by themselves, but they are few and far between. Most hotties are found in groups, plain and simple. And if you donâ€™t go indirect, youâ€™ll creep out the friends and possibly alienate them. It is a group, after all.</p>
<p>> â€œYou have a choice from here. Bail out with a â€˜Pleasure meeting youâ€™ or wing it for the rest of the set, â€˜cause by now you are in. As long as you donâ€™t hit on them in this first minute or two of talk and you convey confidence, charisma, a good sense of humor, smile, are well-dressed and groomed, and humorously neg the beauty of the group, you are money! Be the man they want. Be fun. Be funny. Let them hit on you. Be a cool friend, not a slimy pickup artist. If by the end of this minute-to-two-minute opening act, if a girl is interested she will respond; if not, move on. You are out to get good at this, so practice.</p>
<p>> â€œNow is the time to stop just watching. Get into a fun moodâ€”which I know is hard for the very first girl, but you can fake itâ€”and walk up to many girls, attractive or not, and say hi. Remember to smile when you approach. Then, and here is the best part, say any nonstereotypical opening line you would like, and then after whatever banter you began with, say, â€˜Pleasure meeting you,â€™ and walk off with a smile and a skip to your walk.</p>
<p>> This is your mission. Talk to twenty women in one day. Go alone. Do not intimidate girls by having friends with you. Not one or two girls, either. Twenty. That is a realistic number. If you feel it isnâ€™t, then Iâ€™m telling you now you are completely wrong and your emotions are fighting you. You will control these emotions head-on.</p>
<p>> â€œYou may get the formality of the introduction over with only after you have broken the ice. Letâ€™s say they are laughing and asking you questionsâ€”a minute or two into it. That is when you can do the introduction. Unless they find you interesting, they donâ€™t need to know your name.â€</p>
<p>> â€œYou will begin to self-sabotage your situation by waiting. Enter now! You have to do so many approaches you will literally become numb. You will merely ignore the feelings. You will put yourself in the aware state so much per week that it just doesnâ€™t matter anymore. It removes its own potency. Iâ€™ve crossed the barrierâ€”honest! It works this way. I wouldnâ€™t shit you.â€</p>
<p>> â€œAt the moment of eye contact,â€ I said, â€œgive her a big grin. I mean really smile. This will make her smile instantly. Bam. You can now walk straight over there and she will get all nervous and you will open with something interesting, but not hit on her. That is the power of eye contact. Walk up to her and enter with the Elvis Script. She wants to talk with you, and once you make her feel at ease that you arenâ€™t a guy who is going to hit all over her, then you will be in. Itâ€™s a money situation to get a stare like that from a woman, but you have to take advantage of it and play it right.â€</p>
<p>> â€œAlways be in a conversation with someone. And if you arenâ€™t in set, open the first set you like within the first three seconds of seeing them. Thatâ€™s the Three-Second Rule. That way youâ€™ll always be in set, and therefore youâ€™ll always have maximum social proof. I believe strongly in getting into a club and getting into the action and approaching immediately. Waiting and scoping around is lame.â€</p>
<p>> â€œConsider increasing your statistical chances of success with women by increasing your chances at every phase. Get better at getting out more. Get better at approaching more and more quickly. Get better at the approach itself. Increase your chances with the attraction by dressing better more consistently. Increase your chances of succeeding past the next-day phone call by incorporating your phone rules into your close. Increase this also by kiss closing instead of just number closing. And, increase your chance of success by approaching women when the variables are not all there.</p>
<p>> THE THIRTEEN STEPS OF THE APPROACH 1) Smile when you walk into the room. See the group with the target and enter, Three-Second Rule. Say â€˜Hi.â€™ Smile. 2) Recite a memorized opener, if not two or three in a row. 3) The opener should open the group. When talking, ignore the target for the most part. This is active disinterest. 4) Neg the target with one of the slew of negs weâ€™ve come up with. 5) Convey personality to the entire group (using stories, humor, anecdotes, games, vibing), paying particular attention to the obstacles. During this time, the target sees you are the center of attention. You may do various memorized routines, such as the photo routine, to an obstacle and say to the target, for example when she wants to look at the pictures, â€œWait your turn. Wow, is she always like this?â€ 6) Neg the target again if appropriate. 7) Ask â€œSo how does everyone know each other?â€ If the target is with one of the guys, find out how long theyâ€™ve been together. If a long time, eject with â€œPleasure meeting you.â€ 8) If she is not with one of the guys, say to the group, â€œIâ€™ve sorta been alienating your friend [target]. Is it all right if I speak to her for a couple of minutes?â€ They always say, â€œUh, sure, if itâ€™s okay with her.â€ 9) Isolate her from the group by taking her one-on-one to sit with you. As you do, do a hand kino test. (Does she squeeze back when you hold her hand, directing her through the crowd?) Start looking for IOIs. 10) Sit with her and do a connection routine. Thatâ€™s your reason for isolating. Or an ESP test where you hold her hands (again looking for IOIs). Then do the digital camera routine. 11) Tell her beauty is common but great energy and outlook is rare. â€œWhat do you have inside that would make me want to know you more than a mere face in the crowd?â€ If she begins to give qualities, this is a positive IOI. 12) Stop talking. Does she reinitiate the chat with â€œSo â€¦â€? If so, youâ€™ve seen three IOIs and can â€¦ 13) Kiss close. Right out of the blue. â€œWould you like to kiss me?â€ If this is impossible to perform due to the situation, then time-constraint yourself and say, â€œI have to go but we should continue this.â€ Number close, give phone rules, and leave.</p>
<p>> â€œIâ€™m alone. What do I do? Open a set. Iâ€™m with a two-set I canâ€™t split. What do I do? Open another set. How can I trust the set will open? Because the universe is kind to those who have been kind to it.</p>
<p>> â€œRemember, you are not merely attempting to bond with a single target, but to incorporate yourself into the group of peopleâ€”a social circle that may include family members (specifically parents and siblings), the best friend, the gay friend, the gaggle of girlfriends surrounding your target.</p>
<p>> I donâ€™t actually hit on a girl in the first ten minutes. I merely convey my personality (humor, wit, confidence, charm, etc.). When she realizes that Iâ€™m a great guy and therefore begins showing me indicators of interest, then I know she wants me, and I go for the kill. The opener must really be natural though. The moment you find her, meet her beginning with a â€˜Hi.â€™ Then use a memorized opener and go immediately into the next piece. Itâ€™s one long, seamless set of events. Donâ€™t close unless the signs are there. If the signs are not there, then just leave pleasantly and there is no rejection. Get good in clubs and the rest of the world will be yours.</p>
<p>> SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PICKUP ARTISTS Be humorous! Be enthusiastic! Knock on more doors. Daily. Focus on the pickup arts rather than getting the girl. Do group sets. Let previous sets aid in the next ones. Be playful in your approach. Love women.</p>
<p>> STEP-BY-STEP GAME OVERVIEW 1) Engage entire group, paying attention to all, but least to target and most to guys. 2) Throw a neg at target within five to ten seconds to disarm the obstacles from thinking you are after her. 3) Demonstrate higher value to group while ignoring target (save for negs thrown at her). Lock her into her own set with a prop placed in her hand. 4) Three minutes in, begin to qualify her (in front of her group). 5) Move the entire group so you are leaning against a wall or bar or sitting on a stool. 6) Continue qualifying and find out how they all know each other (whoâ€™s the brother, whoâ€™s the boyfriend). 7) Begin kino tests. (See chapter 2, on physical escalation.)</p>
<p>> â€œLet me ask you this,â€ said Adam. â€œHow would you sum up the entire game to me in a few short sentences?â€ â€œBe entirely comfortable and at easeâ€”remember the Ghost,â€ said Lovedrop. â€œSmile and have funâ€”remember the Flame. Remember the absurd. Speak slowly, with pauses, and with enthusiasm. Sprinkle in DHVs and negs. Sprinkle in IOIs and IODs. And touch everyone. Always be escalatingâ€”use Bait-Hook-Reel-Release as your model.â€</p>
<p>> â€œBefriend the guys,â€ I said. â€œNeg the target. Then find out how everyone knows each other. Be the storyteller to entertain the guys and have them shaking your hand. She will witness the respect. You are the man of the group. Then another neg or two to make the boys laugh, and finally pay some attention to her, going physical with all the obstacles disarmed. This is advanced group tactics. I succeed in these situations. Why? Because I go for the hardest situations just to see if there is a solutionâ€”and I consistently find the solution.</p>
<p>> â€œYour gimmick must be your mouth. You have to talk so you can get a group of people around you and be the center of attention. Your target will then see that, and when you begin talking to her, she will have the desire to find out why all these people are around you.â€</p>
<p>> â€œLetâ€™s talk about creating attraction,â€ I said as I grabbed a Red Bull from the fridge. â€œThe most important concepts for attraction, in my opinion, are demonstrations of higher value (DHVs), being talkative, using the absurd, and negs.â€</p>
<p>> â€œA woman will not know she is attracted to you until she feels a sense of loss. Jealousy is one such feeling of potential loss. Her brain attributes survival and replication value when specific characteristics have been demonstrated, even if she doesnâ€™t logically notice. You see, Mother Nature uses emotions to enforce certain biological imperatives, and those emotions are triggered by DHVs.â€</p>
<p>> â€œPersonally, I have a few favorite DHVs,â€ I said. Preselection. Two women on your arms, or a story of a hot ex-girlfriend actress. Just examples. Leader of men. She observes you holding court in her group. Other men comply with your requests. Protector of loved ones. She detects that your emotional programming is healthy. Disinterest. Using negs, roll-offs, and other IODs. Show willingness to walk.</p>
<p># Demonstrations of higher/lower value</p>
<p>| HIGHER VALUE (DHV)       | LOWER VALUE (DLV)             |</p>
<p>| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |</p>
<p>| Preselection             | Isnâ€™t seen with girls         |</p>
<p>| Social proof             | Rolls alone or with guys      |</p>
<p>| Popularity and status    | Seeks approval                |</p>
<p>| Holding court in a set   | Wallflower, hoverer           |</p>
<p>| Social alignments        | No friends or connections     |</p>
<p>| Disinterest (negs, etc.) | Needy, try-hard               |</p>
<p>| Social intelligence      | Doesnâ€™t â€œget itâ€              |</p>
<p>| Storytelling (Flame)     | Boring, doesnâ€™t add value     |</p>
<p>| Creative expression      | Talentless or a show-off      |</p>
<p>| Unreactive (Ghost)       | Fidgets, leans in, talks fast |</p>
<p>| Has weird emotional      | Healthy emotions responses    |</p>
<p>| Humorous and fun (Flame)Â | Kills the vibe                |</p>
<p>| Dominance and strength   | Weak, no ambition, lazy       |</p>
<p>| Protector of loved ones  | Not protective (miswired)     |</p>
<p>| Competence and lifestyle | Incompetent, low-rent         |</p>
<p>| Health and fitness       | Soft, out of shape            |</p>
<p>| Fashion and grooming     | Dirty, unkempt, bad fashion   |</p>
<p>| Wealth and resources     | Broke, loser                  |</p>
<p>| Height and looks         | Short, ugly                   |</p>
<p>| Embedded value           | Brags instead of vibing       |</p>
<p>> â€œItâ€™s rather easy, and youâ€™d be surprised how often a guy will screw up on these basic things. A good seventy-five percent of guys in clubs donâ€™t smile when approaching. Then youâ€™ve got the guys whose shoes are ugly. And they donâ€™t shave the back of their neck. Then they reveal their shyness by not going up to the girl with a smile right away. Then they are all serious, saying things like, â€˜Wow, you are so beautiful,â€™ instead of â€˜I like Pearl Jam. Iâ€™m not ashamed.â€™â€</p>
<p>> â€œDHVs cannot be bragging,â€ I said, â€œbecause they are demonstration-based and not language-based. When I am telling a story it is being told to the targetâ€™s friends. It is the fact that her friends are interested in my story that is my demonstration of higher value. Then my target responds to the social proof I have created.â€</p>
<p>> â€œOne must convey social proof. To do this, you must pawn women. In other words, you must be willing to lose a woman in order to win the target. Imagine that an eight is into you, but you want the 9.5. You must reject the eight in front of the 9.5 in order to get the 9.5. That is pawning.</p>
<p>> â€œGo after one girl, get nothing. Go after two, get them both. Why? They preselected you to each other. They invested in you. They both witnessed reactive, and therefore committed, behavior in the other. They both needed to work to win you. When did you become the prize? When you set up the jealousy plotline.</p>
<p>> The secret to getting in with a woman is this: Be talkative. Thatâ€™s it. If you have so much to talk about and you bombard them with lots of fun and interesting materialâ€”where you show humor and opinion and passionâ€”then you get to convey your personality. Thing is, a talkative person gets way more play than one who doesnâ€™t. So the secret is to put yourself into a talkative mood.</p>
<p>> â€œWrite this rule down, Adam. Enthusiasm is contagious. It feels good to be excited.â€</p>
<p>> EIGHTY PERCENT RUTE She wonâ€™t want to invest her time unless you have engaged her emotionally to do so. That means you have to do the talking first. I believe 80 percent of the talking should be the guy. Itâ€™s your job to convey enough personality so that she wants to be with you.</p>
<p>> â€œEveryone talks about school and majors and so on,â€ I replied. â€œItâ€™s not original enough. There is no such thing as fluff talk. Everything you say has a purpose. What is the purpose of fluff? To build comfort? Then itâ€™s comfort-building material. But were you in comfort phase or were you actually in attract phase and running DHVs on her? Make sure you arenâ€™t using fluff talk just because you have nothing better to say.â€</p>
<p>> MAKE A CHEAT SHEET 20 minutes: question game 5 minutes: music game 2 minutes: Elvis Script 15 minutes: ESPâ€”Is it real? 5 minutes: Titanic connection pattern 5 minutes: the ant farm I bought for my niece and what I learned 10 minutes: My friend Tal likes this girl but is having problems â€¦ 10 minutes: My other friendâ€™s girl became a stripperâ€”what do you think about that? These are topics of discussion that together run over an hour. Have you told any stories to a buddy on the phone? Give the story a title and write that on a list to put in your pocket or wallet. This outline of topics can be referred to while she is right there. You go into your wallet and check something, then continue talking. She wonâ€™t know you have a cheat sheet.</p>
<p>> â€œLike a comedian, many bits come from reality but the comedian learns that part of the game is removing parts that arenâ€™t funny and changing things to make it more funny.</p>
<p>> â€œâ€˜Whatâ€™s so neat about imagination is, we both have it.â€™ (Pause.) â€˜On the blackboard, I see the number â€¦ three.â€™ â€œWhether you get it right or not, either way say, â€˜All right, letâ€™s try this one more time. This time think of a different number from one to ten. Got it? Picture it in white chalk on the blackboard. You are thinking of the number â€¦ seven.â€™ â€œIf you got the first one wrong and the second right, you look like you finally got it, a one-in-ten chance. If you get both right, which is actually a ninety percent chance, seeing as it is a psychological trick where most North Americans naturally choose three and seven as their first picks, thatâ€™s a one-in-forty chance!</p>
<p>> â€œA neg is a disqualifier. The girl is simply failing to meet your high expectations. Itâ€™s not an insult, just a judgment call on your part. The better-looking the girl, the more aggressive you must be with using negs. A ten can get three negs up front, while an eight, only one or two over a longer time. You can go overboard if they think you are better than them. You can drop the self-esteem right out from under themâ€”just as most tens do to guysâ€”and this isnâ€™t good. You have to get as close to the breaking point as you can without crossing the line. Once you have gotten her right there, you can start appreciating things about her, but never compliment her looks. There is a mutual respect now. Something most guys never get from the girl. This is how you remove a bitch shield. Three negs ought to do it within two or three minutes of neutral chat. Once it is down, you can, from a place of mutual respect, seduce her.â€</p>
<p>> â€œNever hit on a ten at first. Be polite, but donâ€™t compliment her or anything stupid like that at first. I neg and otherwise am polite for the rest of the group. When she is testing me, I neg her, then Iâ€™m polite again. She quickly realizes that she gets more attention from me by being nice to meâ€”and this gives her the opportunity to get her self-esteem back after the little negs. You get a ten through her ego issues.</p>
<p>> â€œWhen shaking hands with a beautiful woman, smile big, look into her eyes, and say, â€˜Nice to meet you.â€™ However, before you finish, turn your head to someone else and immediately say, â€˜Hey did you know â€¦â€™ and go off into something else. This is a great neg because most guys try to impress her. She is accustomed to people paying more attention to her. But it seems you didnâ€™t even notice her beauty. As if maybe you donâ€™t like her. You were polite, but you didnâ€™t try to chat it up with her. As you speak enthusiastically about something to another person there, she will see that you are fun, are not in a sex mood, and so on. You are conveying your personality to her indirectly. I believe quite strongly in this indirect personality-conveying tactic.</p>
<p>> â€œMost important, when you neg, â€˜throw and go.â€™ Throw the neg and then keep talking, without apparently watching for her reaction. Try it the same way that you practice multiple threading: Routine. Pause routine. Neg. Continue routine.</p>
<p>> Adam, I want to tell you something powerful: As long as it comes from the right place inside of you, the inner game of humor, you can make up anything you want and it will work. I am not saying that you should lie to people and they will believe it. Rather, I am saying that you can improvise conversationally, even to the point of the obvious nontruth, even if no one even takes it seriously; it will still work. All it takes is that you are actually laughing inside when you say it. Literal truth and factual accuracy are not necessary for vibing and conveying value. When they are vibing, people only care that it feels good.</p>
<p>> â€œThis is the same reason why you can invent bullshit off the top of your head, embed value indicators in it, and even though everyone knows itâ€™s bullshit, they will still feel attracted to youâ€”because the value indicators are processed at an emotional level. How cool is that?â€</p>
<p>> â€œThis is also the way that I use absurdity in order to control the frame. For example, if someone says to me, â€˜Youâ€™re an asshole,â€™ then I reply, â€˜Iâ€™m an asshole, and Iâ€™m fun.â€™ Everyone laughs. I accept what is said and then take it in my own direction. This is so important!â€</p>
<p>> Reality is literally a waking dream. You can control the dream. You can create moments. Moments filled with pain, loneliness, war. Moments of absolute bliss. Watching your firstborn open her eyes for the first time. If youâ€™re kind to the universe, the universe will be kind to you. Itâ€™s your choice. Itâ€™s filled with potential. And I know by helping you to see it, my grand work here will be far-reaching when Iâ€™m gone.</p>
<p>> I couldnâ€™t help but notice all the math! The universe calculating in real time! I became conscious of the smell of the breeze, of the deep blue in the sky, and the sunlight that shone down on the hills like beams of gold, warming my skin, with the entire city spread out before me in the valley below. This is what really matters. Here I was now, with good friends, feeling nothing but love, and I was within seconds of meeting a beautiful woman in a bikini who would become my next girlfriend. As the universe danced for me, I heard Lovedropâ€™s words again, â€œYouâ€™re Mystery. Think about it.â€ And I thought: Heâ€™s right! I am Mystery. The universe provides.</p>
<p>> The moment you put down this book, thatâ€™s when the excuses will start and the distractions will come. Youâ€™ll have all of the BS reasons to forget your goals and aspirations and any commitments you made while reading this book. The path to mastery in this world isnâ€™t reading. If you really want to master this, you need to engage yourself in its application. Reading is one thing and understanding is another. But application is where the real game is played.</p>

<p> - BUYERâ€™S REMORSE: The sense of regret that a woman will feel if you push for too much physical escalation before qualifying her properly. The pickup artist who causes buyerâ€™s remorse will complain that, although he was kissing his target the night before, now she wonâ€™t even return his phone calls.</p>
<p> - BUYING TEMPERATURE: A temporary emotional state, associated with higher levels of compliance, that can be installed into women through gaming focused on stimulating the emotions. Characterized by giggling.</p>

<p> - CONSPIRACY: A sense between two people that they are â€œin on somethingâ€ together that other people are outside of and wouldnâ€™t understand. Conspiracy is a connection switch, which means that using it installs and deepens a sense of connection between two people.</p>

<p> - FMAC: Find, Meet, Attract, Close.</p>

<p> - HIRED GUNS: Women who are hired for their beauty. This category can include exotic dancers, bartenders, shot girls, hostesses, and so on.</p>
<p> - HOOK: You can say that you have â€œhookedâ€ your target when she is starting to give you IOIs instead of IODs.</p>
<p> - HOOP THEORY: Hoop theory is the concept that people are constantly putting up hoops, metaphorically, and trying to get other people to â€œjump into the hoop.â€ Part of having power in the conversation is about understanding when this happens and being able to control it.</p>
<p> - INCONGRUENCE: A funny feeling that people get when the words you say, and the way you say them, donâ€™t line up. This goes away with practice.</p>
<p> - INDICATOR OF DISINTEREST (IOD): An IOD is a cue that your target will give when she is not attracted to you or interested in what you have to say. She will turn away, look away, disagree, and so on. See the chart in chapter 2.</p>
<p> - INDICATOR OF INTEREST (IOI): An IOI is a signal that your target will display when she is attracted to you and/or interested in what you have to say. She will smile, ask questions, touch you, continue the conversation when you let it drop, and so on. See the chart in chapter 2.</p>
<p> - INNER GAME: This is your inner confidence and intuitive grasp of the game.</p>
<p> - INTERRUPT: An interrupt often occurs when you are talking to your target, and suddenly one of her friends appears out of nowhere and they start talking to each other. A skilled pickup artist will have a gambit ready to use for such situations.</p>
<p> - INVESTMENT: The amount of time and energy that a woman has put into her interaction with you, including how emotionally involved she has allowed herself to be. The more invested she is, the more compliance you will get.</p>
<p> - KINO: A euphemism for the sense of physical touch.</p>
<p> - KINO ESCALATION: Physical escalation. See chapter 2.</p>
<p> - KISSING: A romantic embrace related to erotic love. See chapter 2 for instructions on getting the kiss.</p>
<p> - LEADER OF MEN: A demonstration of higher value, triggering attraction. Pickup artists demonstrate leader of men by taking over the group with storytelling, or by winning over the men in the group and vibing with them, or by teaching them some trick in order to demonstrate authority.</p>
<p> - LOCKING IN: A pickup artist is â€œlocked inâ€ when he has physically positioned himself as the central feature of the group, and when he is physically more comfortable than the other people in the group. LOCK-IN</p>
<p> - PROP: An item that you hand to your target in order to â€œlock her inâ€ so that she has to sit and watch while you ignore her and demonstrate value by telling a cool story to someone else.</p>
<p> - MERGING BACKWARD: Introducing the people in your new group to people that you have previously gamed.</p>
<p> - MERGING FORWARD: Merging forward is accomplished by opening a new group while in set and then introducing both sets to each other. Often this is done by putting your target on your arm and then taking her as your pawn into your next set; you have merged her forward into the next set.</p>
<p> - MICROCALIBRATION: A process of interpreting signals from the target and responding with the appropriate indicator, whether a DHV or an IOI, or an IOD, or a compliance test, that will be most effective in that moment, so that over time the pickup artist will gain more and more compliance from his target.</p>
<p> - MOVE: A good pickup artist will move his target to different parts of the venue in order to build the sense of comfort and trust between them. He will take her to the bar, to the dance floor, to meet his friends, back to her friends, and so on.</p>
<p> - MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONAL THREADS: A good pickup artist Will introduce multiple conversational threads and shift between them comfortably, as friends do when speaking. This is as opposed to speaking only about one conversational thread at a time, which will make people feel like they are talking to a stranger, a common mistake made by inexperienced pickup artists.</p>
<p> - MYSTERY METHOD: See â€œVenusian Arts.â€</p>
<p> - NEG: A statement or action disqualifying oneself as a potential suitor to the target. See â€œDisqualifier.â€</p>
<p> - NICE GUY: The guy who builds comfort with his target but fails to build attraction. He often ends up as her â€œfriend.â€</p>
<p> - NUMBER CLOSE: The act of obtaining a womanâ€™s phone number. A pickup artist will view this as perfunctory, and not as important as building attraction, qualifying the target, escalating physically, building comfort and trust, and so on. A newbie will place too much emphasis on the phone number itself and not enough emphasis on the emotional process that the target must undergo in order for her phone number to have any real value to the pickup artist.</p>
<p> - OBSTACLE: A jealous friend of the target or otherwise member of her group who acts to block approaching men from picking up the target. Often an unattractive friend or a male friend.</p>
<p> - OPENER: A gambit that a pickup artist uses to start a conversation.</p>
<p> - OUTER GAME: The various tactics and techniques of game.</p>
<p> - PAWN: A woman who is paraded about, without her knowledge, by a pickup artist so that he can demonstrate preselection to his real target. The pickup artist will be willing to lose the pawn in order to demonstrate to his real target that he is willing to walk away from a woman. A skilled pickup artist will also use pawns to create jealousy plots with the target.</p>
<p> - PEACOCKING: Wearing at least one attention-getting item in order to cause murmuring about oneself in the field, and to give women an excuse to say something. Peacocking also attracts social pressure, which enables the pickup artist to demonstrate that he is accustomed to, and unreactive to, such attention.</p>
<p> - PIVOT: A woman friend you use to convey preselection and to make groups more receptive to your approach.</p>
<p> - PRESELECTION: A powerful DHV. The target will feel more attracted to the pickup artist when she sees that other women are giving him IOIs.</p>
<p> - PROXIMITY: One IOI that women use when they want you to approach is that they will give you proximity by standing nearby. You may also notice them talking louder as you walk by.</p>
<p> - PUSH-PULL: Alternating between IOIs and IODs as a way of pumping buying temperature in the target.</p>
<p> - QUALIFYING: Showing approval or interest as a reward, usually timed to come just after the target has demonstrated value to you, or complied with escalation, or otherwise jumped into one of your hoops.</p>
<p> - ROLL-OFF: To turn as if to walk away. Often a pickup artist will turn back into the group again after a roll-off, using the move as a quick IOD as part of his microcalibration.</p>
<p> - ROUTINE: See â€œGambit.â€</p>
<p> - SET: A group of people that a pickup artist approaches, usually at a social gathering.</p>
<p> - SOCIAL ALIGNMENTS: A powerful DHV. Your friends, hookups, connections, employees, sources, and other forms of social value. You can directly demonstrate social alignments, and you can also embed it as a DHV in your stories.</p>
<p> - SOLID GAME: As opposed to flash game, which is superficial and only stimulates temporary emotions, solid game involves demonstrating evolutionary value in order to trigger attraction switches in the target. After this, a skilled pickup artist will bait the target to jump into his hoops, building more and more compliance and physical escalation between the two of them.</p>
<p> - STACK: A series of routines, often listed on a Cheat Sheet, that a pickup artist uses to practice his delivery. See â€œCheat Sheet.â€</p>
<p> - STATEMENT OF INTEREST (sol): An overt statement of desire for the target. A great move if done at the right time, which is usually not the approach, but rather after the target has been working for your affection.</p>
<p> - STICKING POINTS: The parts of your game that are giving you trouble and still need practice.</p>
<p> - TARGET: The woman you want to win with your current approach. She is the one you are negging. Her friends are the ones you are winning over in order to disarm as obstacles. She is the one you are using Bait-Hook-Reel-Release on and escalating physically.</p>
<p>  - THREE-SECOND RULE: Within three seconds of entering the venue, approach a set and get warmed up. If you are later not in set, and you spot a set worth approaching, then you have three seconds to approach. This will put you into a talkative state and will avoid problems where girls sense you â€œhoveringâ€ before your approach. Try it.</p>
<p> - TIME BRIDGE: The act of making date plans with your target and visualizing those plans together, instead of merely getting her phone number.</p>
<p> - VENUSIAN ARTS: Mysteryâ€™s system of pickup and his flagship school, located at www.VenusianArts.com.</p>
<p> - WING: Short for â€œwingman,â€ from Top Gun. Your wing is your pickup artist buddy who goes out with you so that you can help each other to pick up chicks. Usually girls who want to meet someone are out in pairs as well, so it works out.</p>
<p> - THE ZEN OF COOL: See â€œThe Ghostâ€ and â€œThe Flame.â€</p>
