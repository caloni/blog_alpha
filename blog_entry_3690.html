  <div class="content">
<p>Uma s√©rie de duas temporadas apresenta um rapaz magro, bem alto e cheio de adere√ßos. Ele junta um grupo de jovens desajustados sem nenhuma experi√™ncia em ficar com mulheres. Seu objetivo: torn√°-los mestres na arte de pega√ß√£o.</p>
<p>Alguns anos depois surge este livro, uma vers√£o atualizada em que Mistery, o rapaz magro, ir√° narrar alguns momentos junto de seus "dudes" e como consequ√™ncia dar aquelas dicas matadoras na arte do sexo e amor.</p>
<p> - ACCOMPLISHMENT INTRO: Mentioning one of your wing‚Äôs notable accomplishments as you introduce him to the group.</p>
<p> - AMOG: The ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù of the group.</p>
<p> - ANTI-SLUT DEFENSE (ASD): A logical trigger in a woman‚Äôs mind that activates to interrupt whatever is happening whenever she feels that her social value could be compromised.</p>
<p> - APPROACH ANXIETY: The anxiety that many men feel when they are about to approach a group of strangers to start a conversation.</p>
<p> - AVERAGE FRUSTRATED CHUMP (AFC): The typical ‚Äúloser guy‚Äù who is unsuccessful with women. Coined by Ross Jeffries.</p>
<p> - BAIT-HOOK-REEL-RELEASE: A metaphor describing the basic concepts of microcalibration. See chapter 2.</p>
<p> - BITCH SHIELD: The rude attitude that some women use in public to blow off the men who approach them.</p>
<p> - BODY ROCKING: Using your body language to cause the group to feel like you are leaving even when you aren‚Äôt, in order to preserve comfort levels in the group, allowing you more time to hook them.</p>
<p> - BOUNCE: To leave the current venue, usually with your target, and go to the next venue. Normally the entire group will bounce together.</p>
<p> - BUYER‚ÄôS REMORSE: The sense of regret that a woman will feel if you push for too much physical escalation before qualifying her properly. The pickup artist who causes buyer‚Äôs remorse will complain that, although he was kissing his target the night before, now she won‚Äôt even return his phone calls.</p>
<p> - BUYING TEMPERATURE: A temporary emotional state, associated with higher levels of compliance, that can be installed into women through gaming focused on stimulating the emotions. Characterized by giggling.</p>
<p> - CANNED MATERIAL: Routines that have been practiced in the past and are ‚Äúin the can‚Äù and ready to be used when necessary in the field.</p>
<p> - CHEAT SHEET: See ‚ÄúStack.‚Äù</p>
<p> - COMPLIANCE MOMENTUM: The process of baiting your target to jump into progressively larger and larger hoops, and thus giving you a higher and higher level of compliance.</p>
<p> - COMPLIANCE TESTING: The actual tests, verbal and physical, that a pickup artist uses to bait the target to give more and more compliance. Compliance testing is part of the microcalibration process.</p>
<p> - CONSPIRACY: A sense between two people that they are ‚Äúin on something‚Äù together that other people are outside of and wouldn‚Äôt understand. Conspiracy is a connection switch, which means that using it installs and deepens a sense of connection between two people.</p>
<p> - CRASH AND BURN: Approaching a group and being rejected. Often a new pickup artist will do ‚Äúcrash and burns‚Äù ten or twenty times in a row just for the learning experience and to desensitize himself to rejection.</p>
<p> - CUTTING THE THREAD: Changing the subject of conversation by ignoring someone‚Äôs thread and instead introducing a new thread of your own. Usually, people just go along with it.</p>
<p> - DEMONSTRATION OF HIGHER VALUE (DHV): An indicator of higher evolutionary value, triggering attraction. See chart in chapter 10.</p>
<p> - DEMONSTRATION OF LOWER VALUE (DLV): An indicator of lower evolutionary value. See chart in chapter 10.</p>
<p> - DISARM: To neutralize an obstacle in the group, usually by winning over the group.</p>
<p> - DISQUALIFIER: A statement or action disqualifying oneself as a potential suitor to the target. See ‚ÄúNeg.‚Äù</p>
<p> - EMOTIONAL STIMULATION: The use of sensory and emotional descriptions, rather than logical recitations of fact, to stimulate the imagination of the listener and install various emotional states.</p>
<p> - FALSE TIME CONSTRAINT: Mentioning that you need to leave soon, for some logical reason. This is done for the same reason as body rocking: to preserve comfort levels in the set, allowing more time for the pickup artist to hook the set.</p>
<p> - FIELD: The social gathering, usually a public venue such as a bar, where a pickup artist goes to practice approaching women.</p>
<p> - FIELD REPORT: A report of a night in the field, usually written. Video and audio field reports are not unheard-of.</p>
<p> - FIELD-TEST: To test a new tactic or idea in the field in order to ascertain its usefulness in pickup.</p>
<p> - THE FLAME: The Flame is an inward vibe where you are happy, smiling, playful, having fun, adding value, positive, talkative, you make things happen, warm, friendly, enthusiastic, appreciative, and a little crazy.</p>
<p> - FLASH GAME: Game that, while flashy and impressive to the observer, is superficial and only based on a temporary emotional state of fun. See ‚ÄúSolid Game.‚Äù</p>
<p> - FLUFF TALK: Mundane conversation used for ‚Äúpassing the time‚Äù when you have nothing better to say.</p>
<p> - FMAC: Find, Meet, Attract, Close.</p>
<p> - FRAME: The context through which something is interpreted.</p>
<p> - GAMBIT: A memorized routine used to accomplish a certain piece of your game. Usually a funny story used to captivate the group and demonstrate value to the target.</p>
<p> - THE GHOST: The Ghost is an inward vibe where you feel comfortable and relaxed, unreactive, unaffected, content, satisfied, not needy, not trying to impress anyone, and without agenda.</p>
<p> - GROUP THEORY: The process of becoming the center of attention in a group, and demonstrating value to the group, usually through storytelling, while negging the target, in an attempt to disarm the obstacles and create attraction in the target.</p>
<p> - HIRED GUNS: Women who are hired for their beauty. This category can include exotic dancers, bartenders, shot girls, hostesses, and so on.</p>
<p> - HOOK: You can say that you have ‚Äúhooked‚Äù your target when she is starting to give you IOIs instead of IODs.</p>
<p> - HOOP THEORY: Hoop theory is the concept that people are constantly putting up hoops, metaphorically, and trying to get other people to ‚Äújump into the hoop.‚Äù Part of having power in the conversation is about understanding when this happens and being able to control it.</p>
<p> - INCONGRUENCE: A funny feeling that people get when the words you say, and the way you say them, don‚Äôt line up. This goes away with practice.</p>
<p> - INDICATOR OF DISINTEREST (IOD): An IOD is a cue that your target will give when she is not attracted to you or interested in what you have to say. She will turn away, look away, disagree, and so on. See the chart in chapter 2.</p>
<p> - INDICATOR OF INTEREST (IOI): An IOI is a signal that your target will display when she is attracted to you and/or interested in what you have to say. She will smile, ask questions, touch you, continue the conversation when you let it drop, and so on. See the chart in chapter 2.</p>
<p> - INNER GAME: This is your inner confidence and intuitive grasp of the game.</p>
<p> - INTERRUPT: An interrupt often occurs when you are talking to your target, and suddenly one of her friends appears out of nowhere and they start talking to each other. A skilled pickup artist will have a gambit ready to use for such situations.</p>
<p> - INVESTMENT: The amount of time and energy that a woman has put into her interaction with you, including how emotionally involved she has allowed herself to be. The more invested she is, the more compliance you will get.</p>
<p> - KINO: A euphemism for the sense of physical touch.</p>
<p> - KINO ESCALATION: Physical escalation. See chapter 2.</p>
<p> - KISSING: A romantic embrace related to erotic love. See chapter 2 for instructions on getting the kiss.</p>
<p> - LEADER OF MEN: A demonstration of higher value, triggering attraction. Pickup artists demonstrate leader of men by taking over the group with storytelling, or by winning over the men in the group and vibing with them, or by teaching them some trick in order to demonstrate authority.</p>
<p> - LOCKING IN: A pickup artist is ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù when he has physically positioned himself as the central feature of the group, and when he is physically more comfortable than the other people in the group. LOCK-IN</p>
<p> - PROP: An item that you hand to your target in order to ‚Äúlock her in‚Äù so that she has to sit and watch while you ignore her and demonstrate value by telling a cool story to someone else.</p>
<p> - MERGING BACKWARD: Introducing the people in your new group to people that you have previously gamed.</p>
<p> - MERGING FORWARD: Merging forward is accomplished by opening a new group while in set and then introducing both sets to each other. Often this is done by putting your target on your arm and then taking her as your pawn into your next set; you have merged her forward into the next set.</p>
<p> - MICROCALIBRATION: A process of interpreting signals from the target and responding with the appropriate indicator, whether a DHV or an IOI, or an IOD, or a compliance test, that will be most effective in that moment, so that over time the pickup artist will gain more and more compliance from his target.</p>
<p> - MOVE: A good pickup artist will move his target to different parts of the venue in order to build the sense of comfort and trust between them. He will take her to the bar, to the dance floor, to meet his friends, back to her friends, and so on.</p>
<p> - MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONAL THREADS: A good pickup artist Will introduce multiple conversational threads and shift between them comfortably, as friends do when speaking. This is as opposed to speaking only about one conversational thread at a time, which will make people feel like they are talking to a stranger, a common mistake made by inexperienced pickup artists.</p>
<p> - MYSTERY METHOD: See ‚ÄúVenusian Arts.‚Äù</p>
<p> - NEG: A statement or action disqualifying oneself as a potential suitor to the target. See ‚ÄúDisqualifier.‚Äù</p>
<p> - NICE GUY: The guy who builds comfort with his target but fails to build attraction. He often ends up as her ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù</p>
<p> - NUMBER CLOSE: The act of obtaining a woman‚Äôs phone number. A pickup artist will view this as perfunctory, and not as important as building attraction, qualifying the target, escalating physically, building comfort and trust, and so on. A newbie will place too much emphasis on the phone number itself and not enough emphasis on the emotional process that the target must undergo in order for her phone number to have any real value to the pickup artist.</p>
<p> - OBSTACLE: A jealous friend of the target or otherwise member of her group who acts to block approaching men from picking up the target. Often an unattractive friend or a male friend.</p>
<p> - OPENER: A gambit that a pickup artist uses to start a conversation.</p>
<p> - OUTER GAME: The various tactics and techniques of game.</p>
<p> - PAWN: A woman who is paraded about, without her knowledge, by a pickup artist so that he can demonstrate preselection to his real target. The pickup artist will be willing to lose the pawn in order to demonstrate to his real target that he is willing to walk away from a woman. A skilled pickup artist will also use pawns to create jealousy plots with the target.</p>
<p> - PEACOCKING: Wearing at least one attention-getting item in order to cause murmuring about oneself in the field, and to give women an excuse to say something. Peacocking also attracts social pressure, which enables the pickup artist to demonstrate that he is accustomed to, and unreactive to, such attention.</p>
<p> - PIVOT: A woman friend you use to convey preselection and to make groups more receptive to your approach.</p>
<p> - PRESELECTION: A powerful DHV. The target will feel more attracted to the pickup artist when she sees that other women are giving him IOIs.</p>
<p> - PROXIMITY: One IOI that women use when they want you to approach is that they will give you proximity by standing nearby. You may also notice them talking louder as you walk by.</p>
<p> - PUSH-PULL: Alternating between IOIs and IODs as a way of pumping buying temperature in the target.</p>
<p> - QUALIFYING: Showing approval or interest as a reward, usually timed to come just after the target has demonstrated value to you, or complied with escalation, or otherwise jumped into one of your hoops.</p>
<p> - ROLL-OFF: To turn as if to walk away. Often a pickup artist will turn back into the group again after a roll-off, using the move as a quick IOD as part of his microcalibration.</p>
<p> - ROUTINE: See ‚ÄúGambit.‚Äù</p>
<p> - SET: A group of people that a pickup artist approaches, usually at a social gathering.</p>
<p> - SOCIAL ALIGNMENTS: A powerful DHV. Your friends, hookups, connections, employees, sources, and other forms of social value. You can directly demonstrate social alignments, and you can also embed it as a DHV in your stories.</p>
<p> - SOLID GAME: As opposed to flash game, which is superficial and only stimulates temporary emotions, solid game involves demonstrating evolutionary value in order to trigger attraction switches in the target. After this, a skilled pickup artist will bait the target to jump into his hoops, building more and more compliance and physical escalation between the two of them.</p>
<p> - STACK: A series of routines, often listed on a Cheat Sheet, that a pickup artist uses to practice his delivery. See ‚ÄúCheat Sheet.‚Äù</p>
<p> - STATEMENT OF INTEREST (sol): An overt statement of desire for the target. A great move if done at the right time, which is usually not the approach, but rather after the target has been working for your affection.</p>
<p> - STICKING POINTS: The parts of your game that are giving you trouble and still need practice.</p>
<p> - TARGET: The woman you want to win with your current approach. She is the one you are negging. Her friends are the ones you are winning over in order to disarm as obstacles. She is the one you are using Bait-Hook-Reel-Release on and escalating physically.</p>
<p> - TIME BRIDGE: The act of making date plans with your target and visualizing those plans together, instead of merely getting her phone number.</p>
<p> - VENUSIAN ARTS: Mystery‚Äôs system of pickup and his flagship school, located at www.VenusianArts.com.</p>
<p> - WING: Short for ‚Äúwingman,‚Äù from Top Gun. Your wing is your pickup artist buddy who goes out with you so that you can help each other to pick up chicks. Usually girls who want to meet someone are out in pairs as well, so it works out.</p>
<p> - THE ZEN OF COOL: See ‚ÄúThe Ghost‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Flame.‚Äù</p>
